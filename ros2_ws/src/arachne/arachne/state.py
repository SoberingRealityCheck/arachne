'''
Node name: state.py
This code is a ROS2 node that collects the total 
state of the robot. It aggregates data from various
sensors and components to maintain a comprehensive 
view of the robot's status.

It also serves as a state machine, ensuring that the 
robot locomotion operates in a consistent state and 
handles transitions between different states.

Inputs: 
 - IMU data via 'imu_data' topic
 - Camera feed data via 'camera_feed' topic
 - Remote movement requests via 'move_request' topic
 - Messages via 'messages' topic

Outputs:
 - Aggregated robot state via 'robot_state' topic
 - Processed movement commands via 'move_cmd' topic
